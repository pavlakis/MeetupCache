    "description": "<p>In a time when security is in the headlines Clinton Ingrams @cfing99 cyber security lecturer at DMU will talk to us about pen testing. PenTesting is cool, right? It's the latest way of slicing bread? It's perfectly safe and legal to test your mates web-site; he won't mind – will he?<br/>PenTesting is fraught with legal and practical issues. The fun part is the fireworks – using testing software to discover previously unknown vulnerabilities (or is the testing actually fun)? This talk aims to dispel some of the myths and misunderstandings of pentesting, and to put you onto a path to learning how to go about pentesting your own and others web applications, in such a way as to avoid the most common pitfalls. We'll also consider how to plan and execute a pentest, and how to report the findings.</p>",
